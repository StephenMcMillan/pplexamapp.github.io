                representation on this Application through any means (including, as the case may be, graphic material,

            <p>The characteristics of the chosen Product will be outlined during the purchasing process.</p>
            <h3 id="purchasing-process">Purchasing process</h3>
            <p>Any steps taken from choosing a Product to order submission form part of the purchasing process.</p>
            <p>The purchasing process includes these steps:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Users must choose the desired Product and verify their purchase selection.</li>
                <li>After having reviewed the information displayed in the purchase selection, Users may place the order
                    by submitting it.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 id="order-submission">Order submission</h3>
            <p>When the User submits an order, the following applies:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The submission of an order determines contract conclusion and therefore creates for the User the
                    obligation to pay the price, taxes and possible further fees and expenses, as specified on the order
                    page.</li>
                <li>In case the purchased Product requires active input from the User, such as the provision of personal
                    information or data, specifications or special wishes, the order submission creates an obligation
                    for the User to cooperate accordingly.</li>
                <li>Upon submission of the order, Users will receive a receipt confirming that the order has been
                    received.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>All notifications related to the described purchasing process shall be sent to the email address provided
                by the User for such purposes.</p>
            <h3 id="prices">Prices</h3>
            <p>Users are informed during the purchasing process and before order submission, about any fees, taxes and
                costs (including, if any, delivery costs) that they will be charged.</p>
            <p>Prices on this Application are displayed:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>either exclusive or inclusive of any applicable fees, taxes and costs, depending on the section the

            </ul>
            <h3 id="methods-of-payment">Methods of payment</h3>
            <p>Information related to accepted payment methods are made available during the purchasing process.</p>
            <p>Some payment methods may only be available subject to additional conditions or fees. In such cases
                related information can be found in the dedicated section of this Application.</p>
            <p>All payments are independently processed through third-party services. Therefore, this Application does
                not collect any payment information â€“ such as credit card details â€“ but only receives a notification
                once the payment has been successfully completed.</p>
            <p>If a payment through the available methods fails or is refused by the payment service provider, the Owner
                shall be under no obligation to fulfil the purchase order. Any possible costs or fees resulting from the
                failed or refused payment shall be borne by the User.</p>
            <h3 id="retention-of-product-ownership">Retention of Product ownership</h3>
            <p>Until payment of the total purchase price is received by the Owner, any Products ordered shall not become

            <p>In order to maintain subscriptions, Users must pay the required recurring fee in a timely manner. Failure

                <li>any and all fees or payments due for renewal will be charged within 24-hours before the end of the

            <h4 id="who-the-right-of-withdrawal-applies-to">Who the right of withdrawal applies to</h4>

            <p>Users that do not fit this qualification, cannot benefit from the rights described in this section.</p>
            <h4 id="exercising-the-right-of-withdrawal">Exercising the right of withdrawal</h4>
            <p>To exercise their right of withdrawal, Users must send to the Owner an unequivocal statement of their
                intention to withdraw from the contract.</p>
            <p>To this end, Users may use the model withdrawal form available from within the â€œdefinitionsâ€ section
                of this document. Users are, however, free to express their intention to withdraw from the contract by
                making an unequivocal statement in any other suitable way. In order to meet the deadline within which
                they can exercise such right, Users must send the withdrawal notice before the withdrawal period
                expires.</p>
            <p>When does the withdrawal period expire?</p>
            <ul>

                    withdrawal period expires 14 days after the day that the contract is entered into, unless the User

            </ul>
            <h4 id="effects-of-withdrawal">Effects of withdrawal</h4>
            <p>Users who correctly withdraw from a contract will be reimbursed by the Owner for all payments made to the
                Owner, including, if any, those covering the costs of delivery.</p>
            <p>However, any additional costs resulting from the choice of a particular delivery method other than the
                least expensive type of standard delivery offered by the Owner, will not be reimbursed.</p>
            <p>Such reimbursement shall be made without undue delay and, in any event, no later than 14 days from the
                day on which the Owner is informed of the Userâ€™s decision to withdraw from the contract. Unless
                otherwise agreed with the User, reimbursements will be made using the same means of payment as used to
                process the initial transaction. In any event, the User shall not incur any costs or fees as a result of
                such reimbursement.</p>

            <h4 id="us-users">US Users</h4>
            <p>Any such invalid or unenforceable provision will be interpreted, construed and reformed to the extent

            <p>Without prejudice to the above, the nullity, invalidity or the impossibility to enforce a particular
                provision of these Terms shall not nullify the entire Agreement, unless the severed provisions are
                essential to the Agreement, or of such importance that the parties would not have entered into the
                contract if they had known that the provision would not be valid, or in cases where the remaining
                provisions would translate into an unacceptable hardship on any of the parties.</p>
